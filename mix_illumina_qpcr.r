# This script calculates and plots the number of microliters of each sample 
# that should be mixed to achieve equal concentration,
# based on qPCR data using Illumina standard library (truSeq?) primers
# Each sample should be qPCR'ed as two dilutions, a more concentrated one (1/10 or 1/16 of the gel extracted DNA), 
# and another 10-fold down from this one; two replicates of each dilution (replicate the dilutions themselves!).

# The model will evaluate amplification efficiency of each sample and infer its intercept, which is what is needed to 
# calculate relative concentrations

# The intercept is computed as a random effect rather than fixed effect, to avoid occasional bad overshooting due to 
# small number of data points for each sample.

# the result will be written to a tab-delimited file "illumina_mixing_chart.txt", open it in excel

# note that by defaiult the script outputs 75% confidence intervals (I feel this is more practical). If you want 95%, specify prob=95 in a call
# to the function dna.mixing (the second line from the end)

# The script requires requires MCMCglmm package. If you don't have it installed, un-remark the next line and execute it (need to do it just once):
# install.packages("MCMCglmm")

# ready? start executing the chunks between #--------- lines one by one, paying attention to the notes (sometimes you will need to remark some 
# lines and un-remark others, depending on your data structure). 
# To execute a chunk of R code, mark it and hit command-return on Mac, control-enter on PC

# look at the first column only, ul2mix - this gives the number of microliters of the original eluate to put into the lane-specific mix to get equal representation of all samples within the lane. Samples of very low concentration might require more than there is of the eluate (100 ul or more); in that case, consider diluting the most-concentrated samples from the same lane (i.e., take the equivalent of 0.1 ul instead of 1 ul of the most concentrated one, which will lower the requirement 10-fold across the whole lane), remaking the low-concentrated ones from scratch, or just dropping them.
